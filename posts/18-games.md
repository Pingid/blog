# What is a game

I realised while writing the last post about nash equalibria that the defintition given in game theory for a game does not include many of the activities we would commonly describe as games. This is because the definition in game theory is intentioanlly restrictive it spesifies games where two or more individuals opperate within a set of rules where the payofs for one individual effect the outcomes of another (shot, 2018). However when talking of games we often include make believe games such as the games played by children where they opperate in an imaginery world in which there are no implied rules.

French sociologist Roger Caillois splits games into four catagories, chance (Betting, Roulette), competition (football, chess), simulation (make-believe, tag), vertigo (Horseback riding, skateboarding)  (Caillois, 2001). Mark Rowes refines these catagories further, he first points out that many games of chance are competive so he instead labels the 'competition' catagory as games of 'skill'. He also points out the games of chance and games of skill have an internal point they have a specific set of goals for players involved and so bellong to the same catagory. He also argues that vertigo which Caillois describes as games that "destroy the stability of perception and inflict a kind of voluptuous panic upon an otherwise lucid mind" (Caillois, 2001, p.23) is not helpful because it would include the one off rolling down a hill and it is the repetition of an action which makes it a game, so instead he calls this catagory 'sequential games' (Rowe, 1992). Rowe refines Caillois's catagories to games with internal point, make-believe games and sequential games.

You may struggle as I did to see sequential games as games at all, skateboarding for example it is easy to see as a play activity but not as a game in itself. Simmilarly with horse-riding one can play games while on horseback however a link between internal point games and the whimsical riding of a horse is I would argue not obviouse. But a way to frame it so that it relates to internal point games is that in sequential games the goal is to get a thrill or overcome a challange within the bounds of a convention. The thrill seeking or overcoming of a chalange in sequential games is analogous to the arbitry goal in an internal point game and the conventions one does this in (eg horseback riding) are analogous to the arbitrary rules of an internal point games. 

This just leaves make-believe games as they have no obvious goal, convention or fixed rules. Callios however points to the sentament 'as if' or 'imagin that' as performing the same function as that of rules (Callios, 2001, p.8). "The convention 'as if' insulates an activity from reality just as surely as a conventional goal or a conventional sequence of behaviour." (Rowe, 1992, p.469). The goal in this post was to assuage my own sceptisism as to what constitutes a game by understanding the common links between popular notions of games.
