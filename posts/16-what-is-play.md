# Whay is play?

The concept of play is difficult to narrow down and has an expansive body of literature behind it, so as a way to stay focused I am going to use this essay to look at the definitions of the word itself. I look primarily at Johan Huizinga's book 'Homo Ludens' one of the earliest comprehensive studies on 'Play'. In the book, Huizinga describes how languages differ widely in what they categorise as play and how many languages have "totally different words for different play forms" (Huizinga, 1980, p.29). Even within the Indo-European languages, there is no general notion of play, indicating that despite it being intrinsic to both human and many animals behaviour it has, as a concept, been "tardy and secondary in some cultures" (Huizinga, 1980, p.29). 

The enigmatic quality of play is apparent in the Oxford English Dictionary where there are 7 entries for its use as a verb alone, the first being, to "Engage in activity for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious or practical purpose." and the second being to "Take part in (a sport)". This division in definitions can be seen in the different ways that languages have categorised play-like activities; Greek, for instance, separates competition from play while Sanskrit has one word for animal and child play, but has a different for gambling, jesting and mocking; Mandarin includes child's games with jesting and mocking but has a separate word for theatrical performance, and like Greek, a separate word for competition (Huizinga, 1980, p.29-p.32). The debate here is whether the serious aspect of competition makes it fundamentally different from what we charactorise as the playing of children or the jesting with a friend, Huizinga however, argues that a play element still exists within competition and so it would make sense for it to be included in what we might term playful activity (Huizinga, 1980).

A large part of my own practice has been building interactive experiences and whether that is to educate or elicit emotion a better understanding of play could help to keep an audience engaged. I think more and more there is a focus on teaching through play, Walker and Fr√≥es write about this in the context of museums, they argue that play can be used "to engage young people and help them feel at home in a space they otherwise perceived as stuffy" (Beale, 2011). To utilise play in building interactive experiences it helps to understand what we might perceive as play. So far I have only touched upon the contention in definitions between childlike play and the competitive play which describes many sports and games but the word has many more meanings which include, to "Move lightly and quickly, so as to appear and disappear" such as the movement of waves or the stochastic movement of a flag in the wind and, to "Be cooperative" such as to 'play ball' (Oxford Dictionaries | English, 2018).
