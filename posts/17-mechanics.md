# What is Game Theory?

In the last post, I examined the concept of play, in this post I want to get closer to understanding why we might play a game by examining the choices players are afforded by the constraints of a given set of rules. I am looking purely at the mechanic's of gameplay as for me it is the mental exercise of attempting to preempt my opponent's decisions that make a game experience enjoyable. An example of a game that does this well is chess, there is no element of chance and the level of complexity means there is no obvious best move. Tic Tac Toe on the other hand again doesn't involve chance but the number of solutions is so small that it is relatively easy to see what the best possible move is and from then on every game becomes a tie. The key here is complexity, not so much that it is hard to learn and remember the rules for but enough that for the majority of the game the best possible choice of move cannot be worked out. This is a personal preference but one that I suspect is crucial to helping games be replayable. A relatively new area of study has developed around analysing the choices of players in games called Game Theory and I use this post to give a short introduction.

Game Theory was developed by Von Neuman and Oskar Morgenstern and then pioneered by John Nash who was made famous in the movie 'A Beautiful Mind' (Ross, 2016). Its applications are widespread as a game of sorts is played every time we interact with other people, "Drivers manoeuvring in heavy traffic are playing a driving game. Bargain-hunters bidding on eBay is playing an auctioning game." (Binmore 2008, p.1). A formal definition for a game that could be studied in game theory is:

> The interaction among rational, mutually aware players, where the decisions of some players impacts the payoffs of others. A game is described by its players, each player's strategies, and the resulting payoffs from each outcome. 
>
> (Shor, 2018)

The definition of rationality in game theory is borrowed from economics and is in this case that players in a game assess all outcomes and make their decisions based solely of maximising their 'utility' (chance of winning) (Ross, 2016). Utility here is another term from economics which is an abstract numerical value assigned to all the possible outcomes of a game for a player (Binmore, 2008).

Although Game Theory isn't directly helpful in the actual creative production of games it doesn't for instance measure how much we enjoy a game or what aspects of a game we enjoy but it does break games down by using tools like decision trees. What attracted me initially is the thought experiments such as the 'Prisoners Dilemma' which illustrate interesting challenges for the players involved with relatively few rules. In my next post, I want to look at some of the thought experiments and how games are used in Behaviour science.
