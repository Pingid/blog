# Play in Language

The study of play as a concept is large and has an extensive body of literature behind it, so as a way to stay focused I am going to use this post to look at the definitions of the word itself. I look primarily at chapter two of Johan Huizinga's book 'Homo Ludens' one of the earliest comprehensive studies on 'Play'. This chapter focuses on how languages differ widely in what they categorize as play and how cultures have grouped play like activities differently.

A general abstract notion of play doesn't exist in many languages and developed late in many others, even within the Indo-European languages, there is no general notion of play indicating that despite its fundamental function it has as a concept has been secondary (Huizinga, 1980). This ambiguity in the play concept is apparent in the Oxford English Dictionary where there are 7 entries for its use as a verb alone, I am going to just look at the first two, the first being, to "Engage in activity for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious or practical purpose." and the second being to "Take part in (a sport)" (Oxford, 2018). A second definition is needed because there is a serious aspect to sport and despite it being mostly done for enjoyment and recreation there are those who compete professionaly, and I assume treat it more like work than play. In Greece where competitive sport is a large part of culture there is a separate word used to describe the participation in competition one destinct from the words that define the other play activities, this is simmilar in sanskrit. Nevertheless, if we are to define a general notion of play, Huizinga argues that competition "bears all the formal characteristics of play, and as to its function belongs almost wholly to the sphere of the festival, which is the play sphere" (Huizinga, 1980, p.31).

In English we refer to the socialising of small children as playing but there is a point (In my case early teens) where we substitute the word play for 'Hang out', 'Meet up', 'Chill' or just the name of an activity such as bowling or watching a movie. After talking to some chinese friends I discovered that this is not the case in Chinese where it is fitting at any age to use the word wan (play) to describe activities with friends or even your own hobbies. This points to a bias in the west to see play as something more childish something that serius adults don't do and yet the 'Informal Social Play' (Sutton-Smith, 1998, p.4) that adults participate in seems to me not dissimalar to the social games of children.

Play is intrinsic to interaction design, not only in creative production but to the engagement of audiences and so a deeper understanding of the nature of play seems crucial to a designer. Here, I have only touched on two small aspects of play the contention between competitive and non competive play and the ambiguities between child and adult play. It is as I said at the beggining a large subject and I plan in future posts to explore further into the concept of play.
