### Essay Question

I want to write an essay which explores enforced constraints on writing/art through looking at the Oulipo movement and exploring questions around the meaning of creativity. I would like to explore whether the current understanding of creativity in neuroscience relates to the constrained practice of the Oulipo. I want to parralel the attempts at creativity in computer science using machine learning and neural networks with what happens within the mind.
