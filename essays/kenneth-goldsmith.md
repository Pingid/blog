# Kenneth Goldsmith
It is hard to make sense of Kenneth Goldsmith and the time he spends on what he calls “uncreative writing”. For what use is a weather, traffic or news report after the day or week in which they are reported. Why transcribe words verbatim from one page to another. Kenneth Goldsmith does both of the things. His published books include “Day” a direct transcription of a copy of the New York Times filling over 900 pages, “Weather” transcriptions of weather reports over a year and “traffic” transcriptions of 30 second traffic reports over a 24 hour period from New York Radio station. Goldsmith is the Museum of Modern Art's first poet laureate, he has been invited to read his poetry to the president in the white house and give a poetry lesson to the first lady. I use this essay to understand better why Goldsmith does these seemingly bizarre practices and hopefully ascertain why he is so widely regarded.

My initial abject confusion was quickly replaced by intrigue after hearing him speak in an interview. He is clear, articulate and doesn’t use ambiguous and broad statements to describe his work. He is also quite aware that his books are not all that interesting to read, infact he worries that if he did make money from his books he might be sued for copyright infringement (Louisiana, 2014). Instead Goldsmith describes himself as a conceptual poet, he is quoted in a New Yorker article saying “I don’t have a readership”, “I have a thinkership”  (Wilkinson, 2017). His work is less about the poems he creates but more about the process he uses to make them.

In an interview goldsmith expresses his love of pranks and his respect for the artist Marcel Duchamp and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, both who are famous for mocking hypocrisy in art or cultural stereotypes (Louisiana, 2014). It would be easy to conclude from this that Goldsmith is doing the same with poetry, and although this may well be the case his work comes with some pertinent criticism especially around copyright. In my experience so much of the arts is focused on originality however this is something that is impossible to measure and I have found on many occasions that what on the surface seemed an original idea was really an adaptation or combination of older ideas. This lead me to think that this image of a great artist being an original thinker is really a mask for someone who is a good researcher and curator. Goldsmith to me takes this idea to the extreme with his shameless appropriation and I think by doing so he is highlighting the hypocrisy of the this idea of the original thinker.
