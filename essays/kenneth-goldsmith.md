# Kenneth Goldsmith
It is hard to make sense of Kenneth Goldsmith and the time he spends on what he calls “uncreative writing”, a practice which has lead him to publish “Day” a direct transcription of a copy of the New York Times filling over 900 pages, “Weather” transcriptions of weather reports over a year and “traffic” transcriptions of 30 second traffic reports over a 24 hour period from New York Radio station. Not only is the idea of transcribing words verbatim from one page to another a bizarre practice but to do it with content which is by nature transient and so obsolete the day/week after it is published seems utterly pointless. Yet Goldsmith is taken seriously in the world of avant-garde poetry, he is the Museum of Modern Art's first poet laureate, he has been invited to read his poetry in the white house and has given a poetry lesson to the first lady. "Day", "Weather" and "Traffic" are a very small part of Goldsmith's work but I chose them because they are so unconventional and provoked in me the strongest scepticism and so, I felt, deserved further consideration.

It is clear that he is more than aware of the impression his work has on most people as he is quoted a New Yorker article saying "I’m the most boring writer who has ever lived" (Wilkinson, 2017), in fact, he worries that if too many people did by his work he might be sued for copyright infringement (Louisiana, 2014). Instead, Goldsmith describes himself as a conceptual poet, he says “I don’t have a readership”, “I have a thinkership”  (Wilkinson, 2017). It is as though he is saying that he doesn't create his poetry to be consumed but instead to provoke others to think about the practice of writing itself.

The sort of fastidious attentiveness which it would take to write a book like "Day" is reflected in the way Goldsmith talks. He has a certain meticulous manner, from the way he enunciates his words to the regular pauses he takes between lines. In an interview, Goldsmith expresses his love of pranks and his respect for the artist Marcel Duchamp and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, both who are famous for mocking hypocrisy in art and cultural stereotypes (Louisiana, 2014). It felt like Goldsmith was hinting that he too was pulling a prank and although this may well be the case his work comes with some pertinent criticism, especially around copyright. In my experience, so much of the arts is focused on originality, however, this is something that is impossible to measure and I have found on many occasions that what on the surface seemed an original idea was really an adaptation or combination of older ideas. This leads me to think that this image of a great artist being an original thinker is really a mask for someone who is a good researcher and curator. Goldsmith embodies this attitude with his shameless appropriation and I think in doing so he is highlighting the hypocrisy of this idea of the creative genius as an original thinker.
