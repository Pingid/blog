# What is boredom and what does it mean for generating ideas?

"Im bored" was maybe my favorit complaint as a child, I said it so much that neither of my parents could take me seriously. I think boredome like depression and anxsiety is an emotional state which is hard to empathise with unless you are feeling it yourself. My mum would normally suggest some houshold chor that needed doing my dad would more often that not reply with a sarcastic "good!". Needless to say neither my mother or father's comments did anything to change the way I felt. As an adult I dont think much about boredom any potentially dull situations can be mitagated with a quick scroll down instagram or a plunge into the rabbit hole of reddit. Which makes me wonder whether 

As an adult I dont find myself thinking much about boredom any potentially boring moment 

As an adult I don't find myself thinking much about boredome in part because I have easy access to emmediat gratification such as the internet or drugs. If I am feeling bored and apathetic I can smoke a joint a binge watch a tv show while stuffing my face with junk food and the feeling subsides at least for a while. Now this of course is no answere not one of the activities are good for ones health and it certainly doens't add to any feelings of wellness 

In this essay I start by defining what boredom is and try to understand some possible causes. I then look into its role in creativity and try to understand what John cage means when he says “If something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that it is not boring at all.”. Finally I try to find an answere to the age of question "can you die of boredom"? 

such as drugs or the internet. It is for this reason that John Cages's famous line, “If something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that it is not boring at all.” caught my attention. I assosiate my own boredom with a lack of self control resulting in behaviour that is detrimental to myself and those around me.

 I would complain in frustration to anyone who would listen they would then go on and suggest an activity or in my dad case reply with a sarcastic "good". But it wasnt that I wanted something to do I already new there was a lot of things that one can occupy ones time with, it was that I didn't want to be bored. Boredome is a sort of restless apathy a general malaise which seemes to permiate all thoughts.

Boredom isn't a lack of tasks to occupy oneself with but a lack of interest in participating in said tasks.



“If something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that it is not boring at all.”

### Notes

### Initial Thoughts

I want to understand the role of boredom in ceative production. Starting by looking at John Cages quote which shows who if you push through boredome rather than give in to the desire for more emediat gratification the boring task get get more interesting. Here boredom is not a tool but something to persevere through
