# What is conceptual art: A series of fictional conversations.

#### Preface

When I first encountered conceptual art during my GCSE art, I did my best to avoid it, i thought that it was something the "artistic type" had an intuitive understandings of. Later on when encountering it at galleries or in the news I again dismissed it as another niche thing that some poeple do for contraversy and attention but that was not really grounded in any sort of logical thought. I dont think this is uncomon and yet now that I have a rough understanding it doesn't seem crazy or illogical. As a way to explore this incongruity I have decided to write the essay as a conversation between my much younger niever self and my current more enlightened self. The format is an attempt to test the boundries of academic writing with the sort of dissenting attitude that marcel duchamp showed towards art.

I believe deeply in academic riger in meticulasly referencing all the ideas posed and so I should be cautious likening my small rebelion to those of Duchamps, the conversation I have written here is in many ways not natural and so unrealistic. But the format isn't about creating a fictional story/situation instead it is an attempt to enter back into my mind prior to my current understanding and using that position to ask my current self difficult questions to test my understanding and write in a way that is grounded and doesn't get lost in high concept.

#### Introduction

Wise Dan: Hello Naive Dan I am going to do my best to give you an understanding of Conceptual art. I am going to take you to three different artworks and we are going to stand infront of them and discuss what they mean and what aims the artist might have had for their pieces. My hope is that you will leave with a good understanding of conceptual art and a little of its history. We are going to start with one of the most influencal artist of the 20th Century Marcel Duchamp and his piece "Fountain".

#### Part 1: Fountian by Marcel Duchamp

TC: Fountain is often hailed as the first conceptual art work and so it seemes the logical place to start when trying to understand the movement in general. Duchamp originaly submitted the piece under the suedanim R, Mutt to an exhibition which said any artist that paid the six dollars could exhibit. Despite this the board of directors to which Duchamp was a member decided not to exhibit it keeping it in the back room during the exhibition. Duchamp then later resigned in protest.

What do you think of the piece?

ST: Its a urinal isn't it?

TC: Yes...

ST: Umm, it looks different to any urinals I have scene before it is far more triangular, it looks as though it was modeled off of the shape of a penis and balls with the tip of the triangle donating the base of the penis.

TC: Does it look like art to you?

ST: Well I suppose in so far as someone had to design it, but I guess then it would be a piece of Design?

TC: Duchamp didn't design it, it was a standered urinal for the time he probably baught it at a plumbing shop. It was a piece which is part of an oeuvre of work he called readymades.                                                                                                                                                  

ST: I am struggeling to see how it is a piece of art then. What exactly is a readymade?

TC: Duchamp never supported any clear defninitions prefering to keep it ambiguas but art historians have supported Andre Breton's definition, "manufactured objects promoted to the dignity of art through the choice of the artist" (Girst, 2014, p.154).

ST: So if an artist thought an object was interesting or beautiful in some way then they could exhibit it as a readymade? surely they are just stealing someone elses work?

TC: That was one of the reasons this fountain was first refused when duchamp submitted it to a gallery. It was also deamed vulger and immoral. Duchamp later wrote in the magazine *The Blind Man* that "Whether Mr. Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no importance. He Chose it. He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful signigicance dissapearred under the new title and point of view created a new thought for that object"(Duchamp, Roche and Wood, 1917, p.5). Ready mades are not about the beauty of the objects themselves infact Duchamp actively tried to avoid choosing objects for there artistic or aesthetic aspects (Tomkins, 2013). 

ST: It sounds like the point in the peice was to create a new thought right? What I dont understand is exactly what that thought is?

TC: That is exactly right, I am glad you picked that out. There are three things to note from that quote first "He chose it", the act of choosing that spesific object is in itself a creative act, two "its useful signigicance dissapearred", by removing the function of the object it becomes art, and third "new title and point of view", by placing the object in a gallery he is giving the object new meaning. It is the fact that this piece is about choice and context not creative generation, it is about the artist as a curator or chooser as apposed to them as a maker that makes this piece a conceptual artwork. (Tate, Readymade, 2017) 

ST: Conceptual art is defined by art that is not about aesthetic beauty but about the thought behind the work? Basically in this piece he is widening the scope of what comes under the definition of art. But what am I as a viewer supposed to get from it.

TC: Yes it is far more about the planning and desisions and as Sol Lewitt said the "execution is a perfunctory" (LeWitt, 1967). For a viewer at the time it opened the questions of what art is and what it could be. For us now I think it is a reminder that sometimes we can get stuck in ways of thinking and that by provoataivly questioning the world and social norms around us we can open whole new avenues of thought in ways which force people to pay attention.

#### Part 2: The current climate

TC: Conceptual art didn't take off until the late sixties 





ST That isn't all that strange to me having visited the Tate modern I have s

ST: So anything can become art if someone who calls themself an artist says so?

TC: Thats it! That is exactly what the piece is questioning. The art isn't in the aesthetics of the piece it is in the action of appropriation. It isn't that the curves represent some emotion or experience it is that you are looking at it in a gallery asking the question "What is art?". This is what is meant by conceptual art,

It is the context which is important here, 

Calvin Tomkins an art critic who's interviewed Duchamp on a number of occasions said "The real point of the readymades was to deny the possibility of defining art" (Tomkins, 2013, p.17).





TC: Duchamp never stated any clear goals with his work he often said he did things just because they entertained him (Cabanne, 2009). He was also a bit of a provocator he liked to chalange the statues quo, he once said that "the real point of the readymades was to deny the possibility of defining art" (Tomkins, 2013, p.17).

ST: What exactly are readymades?

TC: Duchamp never came up with a clear definition he prefered to keep it vague and ambiguas but scholars and art historians often agree with Andre Breton's definition: "manufactured objects promoted to the dignity of art through the choice of the artist" (Girst, 2014, p.154).

I see. Well actually no I dont, Duchamp took a urinal and just because he called it art it became art but it was all a prank?

In a way, he was questioning the status of the artist 

Right so he baught a a urninal signed it with the name R, Mutt and placed it in a gallery? Why? What is anyone going to get from this?

## NOTES

TATE: Conceptual art is art for which the idea (or concept) behind the work is more important than the finished art object. It emerged as an art movement in the 1960s and the term usually refers to art made from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s.
