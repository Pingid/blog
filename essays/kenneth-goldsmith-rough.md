# Kenneth Goldsmith

Goldsmith is seen by most as a conceptual poet but his practice extends into curation, sound, and art criticism. he is by most accounts a provocateur, he appreciates pranks, in an interview, he expresses his love for artist Marcel Duchamp and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who are famous for taking ideas to extremes in art and comedy respectfully (Louisiana, 2014). Perhaps when Goldsmith published his most famous book "Day", a direct transcription of a copy of the New York Times, he is, by calling it poetry mirroring what Marcel Duchamp did with "Fountain"; he is questioning what poetry could be and like Cohen did with his character Borat he is taking this idea to an extreme. Goldsmith calls this practice of appropriation and transcription "uncreative writing" and I have struggled to understand the value of such a bizarre practice and so I use this essay to explore why Goldsmith dedicates so much time to something which seems to me so binal.

Watching interviews I was quickly seduced by Goldsmiths charm, he wears small round eyeglasses nestled in a large and bushy beard, he talks with a meticulous and unambiguous clarity taking time to pause between sentences. It helps that he is fully aware of the impression his work has on people, he is quoted a New Yorker article saying "I’m the most boring writer who has ever lived" (Wilkinson, 2017), in fact, he worries that if too many people did buy his work he might be sued for copyright infringement (Louisiana, 2014). Like with conceptual art, his work is less about the material he produces than it is about the thought behind his work, he says “I don’t have a readership”, “I have a thinkership” (Wilkinson, 2017). Goldsmith is well renowned within the world of avant-garde poetry, he was the first New York Museum of Modern Art's poet laureate and even read his poetry to President Obama at the white house (Wilkinson, 2017), but even so there are those that criticise him, Cathy Park King, for instance, described his work as irrelevant considering all of the societal and political unrest and accused him of jumping on the racial bandwagon by reading browns autopsy at brown university (Hong, 2015).

Despite understanding that "Day" was a conceptual piece and so about provoking thought I found myself quite unthoughtful instead in more of a state of vexed confusion and it took hearing him talk for me to start to think about what this practice of uncreative writing might mean in a broader context. It was the idea that curation and appropriation can be an artistic practice that I found particularly captivating. There are according to software engineer Leonid Taycher 129,864,880 books in the entire world, this is such a large number that no one person could come close to reading even a fraction of them and this doesn't include films and music (Taycher, 2010). It seems to me that as an artist you are just as valuable to society if you bring to public attention pertinent old ideas as you would be attempting to create something new and original. Goldsmith to me points out that like how the Détournement movement gave new meaning to slogans by changing their context, the same can be done with writing.



that an artist can also be someone that researches, curates and appropraits that I found particularly captivating, with 129,864,880 books in the entire world according to software engineer Leonid Taycher 

whether this is exactly true or not is beside the point, the point is there is a vast amount of material out there and ti 



It took listening to him talk for me to understand where he was coming from better and so finally ruminate on the meaning of this book "Day".

Although I understood that "Day" was a conceptual piece and so about provoking thought I found that it still just left me in a sort of benevolent confusion. However After reading about and listening two Goldsmith a few things have sprung to mind as too what value "Day" really has.



What I was supposed to think when 

Goldsmith claims not to get so called writers block and I found this a particularly alluring idea (Frieze, 2014). 







This is very much the case with Duchamps "Fountain" it is now regarded as a key turning point in modern art but I think this is because 

With Duchamps "fountain" 









Kenneth Goldsmith, a poet, word artist, curator, critic, wears small round eyeglasses swamped by a large and bushy beard. He is often pictured wearing brightly coloured or pinstriped suits under a flat-brimmed hat, a possible throwback to his family who was employed in the garment industry (Writing.upenn.edu 2017). I first encountered Goldsmiths work in a writing as practice seminar, where sitting on the tables were his books, “Day”, a direct transcription of a copy of the New York Times, “Weather”, transcriptions of weather reports over a year and, “traffic”, transcriptions of 30 second traffic reports over a 24 hour period from the New York Radio station. These books are all part of an oeuvre of work he has produced using what he calls “uncreative writing”. In the case of these books, this has meant simply reading or listening from one source then typing word for word onto another. Now if you are anything like me you are struggling to see a point, not only is he just moving text from one page to another he is doing it with information that is transient by nature and so useless a day or week after it is published. Yet Goldsmith is taken seriously in the world of  poetry, he is the New York Museum of Modern Art's first poet laureate, he has been invited to read his poetry in the white house and has given a poetry lesson to the first lady. And so I am using this essay to better understand what the purpose of “uncreative writing” is and to conciliate any sceptics like myself.

It is clear that Goldsmith is aware of the impression his work can have on people as he is quoted a New Yorker article saying "I’m the most boring writer who has ever lived" (Wilkinson, 2017), in fact, he worries that if too many people did buy his books he might be sued for copyright infringement (Louisiana, 2014). Instead, Goldsmith describes himself as a conceptual poet, he says “I don’t have a readership”, “I have a thinkership”  (Wilkinson, 2017). It is as though he is saying that like conceptual art his work is far more about the ideas behind it than any material produced.

The sort of fastidious attentiveness which it would take to write a book like "Day" is reflected in the way Goldsmith talks. He has a certain meticulous manner, from the way he enunciates his words to the regular pauses he takes between lines. In an interview, Goldsmith expresses his love of pranks and his respect for the artist Marcel Duchamp and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. Both of these guys are famous for taking there crafts to an extreme 

 and calling transcriptions of traffic reports poetry does reflect the sort of avant-garde rebelliousness of Duchamp's 'Fountain', and in the same way Cohen takes comedy to an extreme Goldsmith has done the same with poetry. 

Calling transcribed traffic reports poetry does reflect the sort of avant-garde rebelliousness of Duchamp's 'Fountain' but to me it also criticises copyright and this is an issue in all creative fields. The degree of originality in a piece of art or anything new is impossible to measure and so many of the most inspiring ideas are adaptations of previous concepts. When Goldsmith says he doesn't get writer's block I think he is also saying to be an artist one doesn't have torture oneself trying to come up with truly original ideas but an artist is also a researcher and curator (Frieze, 2014). 



It is hard to make sense of Kenneth Goldsmith and the time he spends on what he calls “uncreative writing”, a practice which has lead him to publish “Day”, a direct transcription of a copy of the New York Times filling over 900 pages, “Weather”, transcriptions of weather reports over a year and “traffic”, transcriptions of 30 second traffic reports over a 24 hour period from New York Radio station. Not only is the idea of transcribing words verbatim from one page to another a bizarre practice but to do it with content which is by nature transient and so obsolete the day/week after it is published seems utterly pointless. Yet Goldsmith is taken seriously in the world of avant-garde poetry, he is the New York Museum of Modern Art's first poet laureate, he has been invited to read his poetry in the white house and has given a poetry lesson to the first lady. "Day", "Weather" and "Traffic" are a very small part of Goldsmith's work but I chose them because they are so unconventional and provoked in me the strongest scepticism and so, I felt, deserved further consideration.

It is clear that Goldsmith is more than aware of the impression his work has on most people as he is quoted a New Yorker article saying "I’m the most boring writer who has ever lived" (Wilkinson, 2017), in fact, he worries that if too many people did buy his work he might be sued for copyright infringement (Louisiana, 2014). Instead, Goldsmith describes himself as a conceptual poet, he says “I don’t have a readership”, “I have a thinkership”  (Wilkinson, 2017). It is as though he is saying that he doesn't create his poetry to be consumed but instead to provoke others to think about the practice of writing itself.

The sort of fastidious attentiveness which it would take to write a book like "Day" is reflected in the way Goldsmith talks. He has a certain meticulous manner, from the way he enunciates his words to the regular pauses he takes between lines. In an interview, Goldsmith expresses his love of pranks and his respect for the artist Marcel Duchamp and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, one famous for mocking hypocrisy in art and the other the hypocrisy in cultural stereotypes (Louisiana, 2014). Calling transcribed traffic reports poetry does reflect the sort of avant-garde rebelliousness of Duchamp's 'Fountain' but to me it also criticises copyright and this is an issue in all creative fields. The degree of originality in a piece of art or anything new is impossible to measure and so many of the most inspiring ideas are adaptations of previous concepts. When Goldsmith says he doesn't get writer's block I think he is also saying to be an artist one doesn't have torture oneself trying to come up with truly original ideas but an artist is also a researcher and curator (Frieze, 2014).
