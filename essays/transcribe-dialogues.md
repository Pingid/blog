# A Window onto something Else

Marcel Duchamp: It was probably my interpretation of Cubism at that moment. There was also my ignorance of perspective and of the normal placing of figures. The repetition of the same person four or five times, nude, dressed, and in the shape of a bouquet in "Dulcinea," was primarily intended, at that time, to "Detheorize" Cubism in order to gie it a freer interpretation.

Pierre Cabanne: The curious, but hardly revolutionary, young painter that you were in 1911 must have regarded with interest the step you had just taken. One thing that strikes me about your two works of that year, the "Portrait, or Dulcinea," and th "Sonata" is the appearance of simultaneity.

Duchamp: I Knew Delaunay by name, not more. But be careful, because simultaneity is not movement, or at least not movement as I understand it. Simultaneity is a technique for construciton, colour construction. Delaunay's "Eiffel Tower" is, in short, a dislocation of the Eiffle Tower, one that could fall. No one was bothering very much with the idea of movement, not even the Futurists. In the first place, they were in Italy, and they weren't very well known.

Cabanna: If I mentioned simultaneity, its because Delaunay painted, "The Window on the Town"  #3, at that time,which was the first appearance of the simultaneous contrasts that he developed later.

Duchamp: At the time I didn't go in for such things. And Italy was along way away. Moreover, the word "Futurism" hardly appealed to me. I dont knwo how it happened but, after "Dulcinea," I felt th nedd to do still another small canvas, called "Yvonne and Madeleine Torn Up in Tatters." In this case , it's more tearing than it is movement. This tearing was fundamentally an interpretation of Cubist dislocation.

Cabanna: The Futurist Manifesto had appeared in the Figaro of February 10, 1910 - handle you read it?

Duchamp: No, it isnt Cubist. Picasso and Braque never went in for it. I must have seen Delaunay's "The Windows"  in 1911, at the Salon des Independents, where I believe the "Eiffel Tower" also was. That "Eiffel Tower" must have moved me, since Apollinaire said in his book on Cubism that I was influenced by Braque, and by Delaunay. Great! When one goes to see peopl, one is influence even if one doesn't think about it!

Cabanna: So there is, on one hand, the Cubist decomposition, and on the other, simultaneity, which is not at all Cubist.
