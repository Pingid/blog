He also points out the games of chance and games of skill have an internal point they have a specific set of goals for players involved and so belong to the same category. He argues that the vertigo category which Caillois describes as games that “destroy the stability of perception and inflict a kind of voluptuous panic upon an otherwise lucid mind” (Caillois, 2001, p.23) is not helpful because it would include the one-off rolling down a hill and it is the repetition of an action which makes it a game, so instead he calls this category ‘sequential games’ (Rowe, 1992).

Rowe (1992) points to the intent of getting a thrill or over coming a challenge within the bounds of a convention such as skateboarding or horseriding as analogous to the arbitrary goal in an internal point game.

Callios, however, points to the sentiment ‘as if’ or ‘imagine that’ as performing the same function as that of rules (Callios, 2001, p.8). “The convention ‘as if’ insulates an activity from reality just as surely as a conventional goal or a conventional sequence of behaviour.” (Rowe, 1992, p.469).</p>\\n<p>The link between playing chess, skateboarding and playing doctors at first thought seemed tenuous however what is intrinsic to all is that it is the process of playing them that is the rewarding or to put it more formally a game is “An abstract object (either a sequence or a goal) which is designed to have no instrumental value; the realization or pursuit of which is intended to be of absorbing interest to participants or spectators” (Rowe 1992, p.487).</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Caillois, R.
